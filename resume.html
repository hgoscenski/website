        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
            I am very proficient at learning new frameworks, languages, and toolchains. 
            I have taught myself everything I know about system adminstration using Linux and Windows.
            I taught myself how to use python prior to taking a formal programming class and I have primarily taught myself all of the languages I am familiar with.
            I experimented with different virtualization options as well as with several different OS's for both my server and desktop environments.
