<h2>
    About My Computers
</h2>

<p1>
    I typically name my desktop computers by their case i.e. the computer called H440 is built in an NZXT H440 case. <br>
    I have been building computers about once a year for the past couple of years and I am starting to have quite a collection.<br>
    The computers are basically for my own use in different capacities, some are used for different experiments, see H440v1, and 
    some end up getting sold to fund the next one, see again H440v1.

</h2>

<p1>
    I built this computer for my family to replace an old computer using an AMD Athlon 64 x2. <br>
    That computer served us well but it was time for an upgrade and I spearheaded the operation. <br>
    This was the first time I built a computer from parts and it kicked off my enthusiasm to do so. <br>

<h2>
    Refine
</h2>
<p1>
    This was the first computer I built solely for myself. This computer is running Windows 10 Education Edition. <br>
    It, like all of my current computers, is running an Intel Processor, in this case an i7 4790K. <br>
    It is serving as a server for some of my utilities as well as serving as a virtualization host using Hyper-V. <br>
    Hyper-V is currently hosting an Ubuntu 16.10 Guest to use as a webserver as well as a remote shell. <br>

        H440v1
    </del>
</h2>
<p1>
    I built this one using an i7 6700K processor and then promptly used that base to construct a Hackintosh. <br>
    This was my first attempt at a Hackintosh and it went moderately well. It was 98% complete with only an issue with sleep. <br>
    I used it as a Hackintosh for a few months then sold it to fund the construction of H440v2.<br>
<h2>
    H440v2
</h2>
<p1>
    This is my most recent computer designed to be more powerful than anything else I have built. <br>
    It is running an i7 6850 hexacore processor, and its grotesquely underused for the power it has. <br>
    It serves as my gaming computer as well as a Windows environment to remote into when such a thing is called for. <br>
    This computer also serves as my daily use computer for all standard desktop usage.<br><br>
