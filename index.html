	<p>
		I'm Harrison Goscenski, a programmer/problem solver, and a Boy Scout. I live in Chicago at the moment and am finishing up
		school. I currently work for both Loyola University Chicago and the Geek Squad. I am a TA for an introductory comp sci
		course at Loyola and a repair agent at for the Geek Squad.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have been keeping myself busy the past few years finishing up my education and working to set myself to get a job out of
		college. I'm graduating with a degree in IT that I wil hopefully leverage to get a job as a sysadmin or software engineer.
		I have been a Boy Scout for as long as I have been around and I continue to be active, working with my summer camp as the
		program director.

		Introduction
	</h2>
	<p>
		I'm currently a student at Loyola University Chicago, studying IT and Philosophy. I have been exposed to several languages
		but I have taken to Java in particular at this point. I hope to someday work in IT potentially focusing on security and
		adminstration.

		Contacting Me
	</h2>
	<p>
		Email is the best way to get a hold of me:
		<a href="mailto: harrison.goscenski@gmail.com">harrison.goscenski@gmail.com</a>
		No one will probably read this website, unless they know me, so you probably already have met/talked to me before. I answer
		mail, so long as it appears that it was written by a person and not a script.
